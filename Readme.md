# What is it?

Hardware probing and benchmarking tools for Subutai. Lightweight and does not 
force people to wait too long. The generate json file is used to understand 
the underlying hardware for pricing.

# Today and Tomorrow

Right now this is a Ruby GEM but it should also have a python version for use
separately. The Ruby GEM is for using it with edge peers based on our vagrant
virtual machine images.

The future Python library might be used for ansible provisioning scripts to 
provision hosting provider and cloud provider based peers.
